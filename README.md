## Week #8 Exercise 3.10 
### Invoice Class
C++ How to Program, 10/e, Deitel

Create a class called Invoice that a hardware store might use to represent an invoice for an item sold at the store. An Invoice should include four data membersâ€”a part number (type string), a part description (type string), a quantity of the item being purchased (type int) and a price per item (type int). Your class should have a constructor that initializes the four data members. Provide a set and a get function for each data member. In addition, provide a member function named getInvoiceAmount that calculates the invoice amount (i.e., multiplies the quantity by the price per item), then returns the amount as an int value. If the quantity is not positive, it should be set to 0. If the price per item is not positive, it should be set to 0.

Notes:
* I added overloaded comparison and stream operators.
* Compiled with MS Visual Studio 2017 Community (v141).
* Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements of PCC CIS-278.
